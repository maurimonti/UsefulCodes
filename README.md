# UsefulCodes
Repository for all those small programs that do not fall in any larger project but are indeed useful

Wavenumber_Converter.py: small code that converts wavenumber in wavelength and frequency #
(for now only in cm^-1, nm and THz) mostly written to practice the implementation of a case structure in Python (but indeed useful).

Pendulum.py: simulation of a chaotic pendulum (no linear approximation, drag and driving forces) with an animation
Not fully tested yet!
Mostly written to practice the matplotlib animation.

Conductivity.py: stupid script that plots some conductivity models, useful to understand how they behave
